         <br>
         <p><b>(“Shine the Light” Law)</b></p>
         <br>
         <p>Effective as of January 1, 2005, California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code Sections 1798.80, et seq.) provides California residents with the
         right to receive certain disclosures when personal information that has been collected online is shared with third parties for direct-marketing purposes.<p>
         </p><br>
         <p>If you are a California resident and you provided personal information to (GBBDB) through a website in the past, and/or if you do so in the future, you are 
         entitled to submit a request in writing to (GBBDB) for a description of the information we may have provided to third parties. To submit your written request,
         please send it to info@GBBDB.us and put the following words in the subject line of the email: “California Privacy Request.”Within 30 days after receipt of 
         your request, we will send you a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year, 
         along with the names and addresses of the third parties who actually received such information, if any. We reserve our right not to respond to requests 
         sent more than once in a calendar year.Please note that the California “Shine the Light” law does not cover all aspects of on-line information sharing, 
         and our policy relates only to information covered by the law.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Your Privacy Rights. In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal 
         information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under 
         applicable data protection laws. These may include the right<br> 
         <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#637983;">(i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,</span><br> 
         <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#637983;">(ii) to request rectification or erasure;</span><br>
         <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#637983;">(iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and</span><br> 
         <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#637983;">(iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances,</span><br> 
         you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. 
         We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If we are relying on your consent to process your personal 
         information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before 
         its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you 
         are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to<br> 
         your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact <br>

         <p><b><div id="num3"><p class="infotext">3. Your Business Logins and Verifications</p></div></b> To access certain portions and features of the websites, including the portions where the Services are offered,
         we require you to register and select a business name and password. Some personal data is collected during the registration process. We may then ask for 
         additional information, including personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information. When you make a purchase on GBBDB, when you subscribe 
         to the Services, and/or when you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for certain personal information such as your name, address, e-mail 
         address, or credit card number, in order to process your order, manage your subscription, administer the contest, or send you promotional e-mails. Providing
         personal information in these instances is solely your choice; you do not need to provide such information, make purchases, or enter such contests to browse 
         our Websites as a Visitor. You can remove your e-mail address from our e-mail list at any time by following the procedures set forth to opt out procedures 
        (see business contracts/deals in section 12) or by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in every e-mail from (GBBDB). In addition, you can modify your information<
         or change your preferences, as set forth in Section 10 below (“Reviewing or Changing Your Information”). Information obtained through the Websites and/or the 
         Services may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than our Websites, including both offline and online 
         sources.</p>
         <br>
         <p><b><div id="num4"><p class="infotext">4. How We Share Your Information</p></div></b> (GBBDB) may share your personal information: (i) with GBBDB’s parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors 
         (collectively the “GBBDB Parties”), or with third parties who are under obligations of confidentiality with any of the (GBBDB) Parties, (ii) if a 
         (GBBDB) Party is required by law to do so, (iii) in the event of a transfer of ownership of a (GBBDB) Party, merger or other similar transaction, 
         or (iv) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. The following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed 
         to third parties: Information Collected By the Websites. We collect two types of information from users of the Websites: personal information
         described below; and non-personal information such as information about traffic patterns on the Websites.
         We may employ third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our Websites, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, 
         communications or other services. Those third parties may include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us. They only have access 
         to personal information needed to perform their functions, and they may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than 
         providing or improving (GBBDB) services and offerings. We may share your information with third parties whom we believe have information of interest to you. In
         addition, we may share certain non-personal information with third parties for advertising, promotional and other purposes. For example, we may work with third 
         party advertising companies, to serve and track our ads. These third parties may install other cookies. Our advertising partners may use the non-personal 
         information they collect from our Websites, in the aggregate, to help us better market and serve our customers. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Websites 
         and the Services and does not address the practices of third parties who may collect your personal information. You may visit other websites, through links on the 
         Websites, which may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those linked 
         websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. In order to 
         provide you with the information, products or services which you have requested, we may share or transfer your personal information with our parent, affiliates 
         or subsidiaries, or third party agents acting on their behalf.</p>
         <br>
         <p><b><div id="num5"><p class="infotext">5. API'S, Google Maps, Geolocation Data, and Identifiers</div></p></b><br>
         <br> 
         <p><b>Identifiers:</b> “Identifiers” covers a broad range of information, including things like name, email address, 
         billing address, and IP address. We collect personal information that falls into this category. For example, for subscribers we have an email address and payment 
         information (such as a credit card). We collect IP addresses when you connect to our service online. These sorts of identifiers are connected to your (GBBDB) account. 
         There are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (third party advertising cookies on our website) that we do not associate with your account, but that
         can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications.</p>
         (GBBDB) utilizes Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. In order to track your (GBBDB) session usage, (GBBDB) places a Google Analytics 
         cookie (ga) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser. This ID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information such as email, phone number,
         name, etc. (GBBDB) uses Google Analytics to track aggregated website behavior, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, etc. This information is important 
         for improving the (GBBDB) user experience and determining (GBBDB) site effectiveness. If you wish to remove Google Analytics from your site experience, you can 
         install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On.
         Internet or other electronic network activity information: Our service is an online service, so we collect CCPA personal information in this category, such as your 
         interactions and activities within our service.</p>
         <br>
         <p><b>Geolocation Data:</b> Our streaming application does not collect precise geolocation data from GPS sensors. However, we do collect IP addresses so we can determine your general
         location in order to give you a better first interaction with our service.
         Inferences: We have a recommendation system that tries to help return you custom titles based on what we feel you will like most.
         Uses of CCPA personal information. We use categories of CCPA personal information listed above for the purposes improving your experience when interacting with the online
         service. This use is noted below:<br>
         We use personal information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to process your registration, your recurring payments,
         and to communicate with you on these and other topics. For example, we use such information to:<br>
         determine your general geographic location, provide localized content, provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for titles and shows we think will
         be of interest to you;<br>
         to coordinate with Partners around making the (GBBDB) service available to members and providing information to non-members about the availability of the (GBBDB) service, based on
